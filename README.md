## Javascript-Projects
Here I will be utilizing Javascript and creating projects as I go through the Javascript course through The Tech Academy.
As I learn new concepts and ideas, I will be pushing them to this repository and keeping this Readme updated as I go through. 
A lot of the random projects and challenges here are for learning expierence, but there are also projects that are fully functional through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
<h1>-<a href="https://github.com/Jlomb1/Javascript-Projects/tree/main/Pizza_Project" target="new">Pizza Menu Project<a/></h1>
This project is an online menu where you can pick your size of the pizza, the topping for the pizza, and come to a total amount for the order! This project was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
<h1>-<a href="https://github.com/Jlomb1/Javascript-Projects/tree/main/Calculator" target="new">Calculator Project<a/></h1>
This project is a basic calculator utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
<h1>-<a href="https://github.com/Jlomb1/Javascript-Projects/tree/main/TicTacToe" target="new">Tic-Tac-Toe<a/></h1>
This is a basic TicTacToe(cat-dog edition) where JavaScript was a giant chunk of this project. The game is simple, you go against the computer to see who can get 3 
in a row! First one to do so wins!
<h2>Again, the remainder of what you see in this repository are random challenges that helped me get a better understanding of JavaScript!</h2>
